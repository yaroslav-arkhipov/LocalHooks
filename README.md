# LocalHooks
The library is designed to replace the necessary methods with your own ones while the program is running. The library is aimed at solving problems that are aimed at correcting some basic functionality of base libraries without directly editing them.

In the example of use, a correction of the TextHint functionality for the TCustomEdit class has been implemented (on some operating systems, TextHint is not displayed without including styles in the project). If you encounter the same problem, just connect the .pas file from the sample folder to your project.
